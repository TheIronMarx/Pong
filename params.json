{"name":"ePing","tagline":"A fresh implementation of PING. Created for an NDSU Capstone Project.","body":"### ePing overview\r\nThis application is a new version of the classic PING application, originally written by Mike Muuss in 1983. The name is derived from the term used in sonar technology, and uses the Internet Control Message Protocol to send requests and hopefully receive replies. The time between the request and reply is measured, and statistics are calculated.\r\n\r\nOur application was developed for a few reasons. First, our goal is to make the program more understandable and updated to modern coding standards with self-identifying variable/function names and plenty of comments. Ericsson is the sponsor of this project as part of a North Dakota State University Computer Science Capstone project. They've provided us with requirements for some various features they would like added to Ping.\r\n\r\nTo clone and compile our project:\r\n```\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:poodus/ePing.git\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nSet time between packets (manual or random, based on a normal distribution)\r\nExclude pings from summary\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nShane Reetz (@poodus), Sam Stutsman (@theironmarx), Chris Berstler (@drsir), and Jeff Geiser (@jrgeiser).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nUser manual here: https://github.com/poodus/ePing/wiki/ePing-User-Manual","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
