Pong - a flexible Ping program
==============

We're building a flexible ping utility, which is be command-line executable
on both Mac and Linux. Ping for the 21st Century. Ping uses ICMP Echo Requests
to test round trip packet time and to detect packet loss across networks.

Developed as a NDSU Capstone Project -- Spring 2013 -- Dr. Dean Knudson.
